            <p>The GT circuit was created by tournament organizers from around Alberta. The idea behind it was to bring our local (provincial) gaming community closer together.</p>

            <p>Players are to compete throughout the year in qualifying tournaments all over Alberta.</p>

            <p>To sign up, all you have to do is sign up for a AWGT qualified tournament, and you can choose to have your score count towards the final Alberta Grand Tournament held in August.</p>

            <p>We post your name on our website along with your circuit score which is derived from your OVERALL position in tournaments. Your score is based on how many people attended the tournament, as well as what place you came in.
                (For instance, if you attend a 20 person tournament and place 4th Overall, you will receive 16 points. You gain an additional 5 points for winning a category such as Best Painted, or Best Sport.)</p>

            <p>Any player who wins a Best Overall in a PREMIER tournament wins an automatic invite to the GT in August.</p>

            <p>Your points accumulate throughout the year, and at the end of the season we select the top players who ranked highest to play in the GT even if they didn't come in first at any of the qualifying tournaments they attended (This of course excludes those who already have an invite). The winner of the Grand Tournament will be crowned Provincial Champion, and will walk away with the grand prize!</p>

            <p>It's a great way to see how you rank up to everyone else in Alberta, and provides a benefit for coming out and being a part of the community, and playing a few games!</p>

            <p>Keep a close watch on our page for updates on upcoming qualifying tournaments and more info!</p>
